# CMNH-Hall-Of-Botany

Prototyping using iBeacons to add an experience to the CMNH Hall Of Botany.

The current plan is:

* Playing ambient sound dependent on location and distance to certain displays.

TODOS:  
- [ ] Fade from sound to sound, instead of abrupt changes  
- [ ] Test in actual Hall of Botany room  
- [ ] Look into indoor location SDK  as a way to increase accuracy
